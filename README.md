# Renda
Lightweight Web Application Develelopment Framework

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get your copy of Renda up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Renda.JS - Introduction
Renda.js is our own front-end app engine written with TypeScript. 
With RendaJS, writting web apps is easier, faster and efficient as we do not restrict the developer to certain tools, neither do we enforce our mode of development on your project. RendaJS follows the MVC parttern of structuring code which is a tested and trusted industry standard way of modelling projects. With this, you can be assured of best practices when using Renda.
RendaJS can be used in conjuction with any other javascript framework: this means that you can decide to outsource routing, DOM manipulation, data binding and modelling and still have RendaJS on the side for those functions you prefer RendaJS for.
