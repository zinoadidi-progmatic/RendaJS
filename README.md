## Render.JS - Introduction
Render.js is our own front-end app engine written with TypeScript. 
With RenderJS, writting web apps is easier, faster and efficient as we do not restrict the developer to certain tools, neither do we enforce our mode of development on your project. RenderJS follows the MVC parttern of structuring code which is a tested and trusted industry standard way of modelling projects. With this, you can be assured of best practices when using render.
RenderJS can be used in conjuction with any other javascript framework: this means that you can decide to outsource routing, DOM manipulation, data binding and modelling and still have RenderJS on the side for those functions you prefer RenderJS for.
